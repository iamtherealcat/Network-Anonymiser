## What it does

This tool doesn't just change your MAC address. It also modifies and deletes various network related registry entries and settings that these servers use to track and ban players. This helps prevent recurring bans by removing the factors that servers like Warbandits, WerewolfGaming, and HollowServers use for network based tracking.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Administrator privileges
- No EAC HWID ban (this is NOT an HWID spoofer)

## Project Status

**Note**: This project was quickly developed and is currently in a testing phase. While it is fully functional, it is not a complete/full featured release. Some features may be missing or need refinement. The same applies to the GUI it was hastily put together and may have some rough edges, but it is fully functional.

**Source Code**: I may add the source code to this repository soon, depending on whether I want to reveal my methods or not. I'm leaning towards not sharing it.
